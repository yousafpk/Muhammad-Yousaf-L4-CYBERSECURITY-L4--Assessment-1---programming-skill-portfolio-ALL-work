def hello():
    print("Hello")  # This line prints "Hello" to the console when the function is called

def main():
    hello()  # This line calls the hello() function so it runs and prints "Hello"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()  # This ensures that main() runs only when the program is executed directly
